    XR --> |"spec.resourceRef"| MR2
    XRC --> |"spec.resourceRef"| XR

```

## General debugging steps

Most error messages are logged to resources' event field. Whenever your Composite Resources are not getting provisioned, follow the following:
1. Get the events for the root resource using `kubectl describe` or `kubectl get event`
2. If there are errors in the events, address them.
3. If no errors, follow its sub-resources. `kubectl get <KIND> <NAME> -o=jsonpath='{.spec.resourceRef}{" "}{.spec.resourceRefs}' | jq`
4. Go back to step 1 using one of resources returned by step 3.

_Note:_ Debugging is also enabled for the AWS provider pods. You may find it
useful to check the logs for the provider pods for extra information on
failures. You can also disable logging
[here](/bootstrap/eksctl/crossplane/aws-provider.yaml#L24).

```bash
# kubectl get pods -n crossplane-system
NAME                                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
crossplane-5b6896bb4c-mjr8x                         1/1     Running   0          12d

# For the AWS provider logs
# kubectl -n crossplane-system logs provider-aws-f6a4a9bdba04-84ddf67474-z78nl | less

# For Crossplane core logs
# kubectl -n crossplane-system logs crossplane-5b6896bb4c-mjr8x  | less
```

## Debugging Example

### Composition
An example application was deployed as a claim of a composite resource. Kind = `ExampleApp`. Name = `example-application`.

The example application never reaches available state.


1. Run `kubectl describe exampleapp example-application`
    ```
    Status:
    Conditions:
        Last Transition Time:  2022-03-01T22:57:38Z
        Reason:                Composite resource claim is waiting for composite resource to become Ready
        Status:                False
        Type:                  Ready
    Events:                    <none>
    ```

2. No error in events. Find its cluster scoped resource (composite resource).
    ```bash
    # kubectl get exampleapp example-application -o=jsonpath='{.spec.resourceRef}{" "}{.spec.resourceRefs}' | jq

    {
      "apiVersion": "awsblueprints.io/v1alpha1",
      "kind": "XExampleApp",
      "name": "example-application-xqlsz"
    }
    ```
3. In the above output, we see the cluster scoped resource for this claim. Kind = `XExampleApp` name = `example-application-xqlsz`
4. Get the cluster resource's event.
    ```bash
    # kubectl describe xexampleapp example-application-xqlsz

    Events:
    Type     Reason                   Age               From                                                             Message
    ----     ------                   ----              ----                                                             -------
    Normal   PublishConnectionSecret  9s (x2 over 10s)  defined/compositeresourcedefinition.apiextensions.crossplane.io  Successfully published connection details
    Normal   SelectComposition        6s (x6 over 11s)  defined/compositeresourcedefinition.apiextensions.crossplane.io  Successfully selected composition
    Warning  ComposeResources         6s (x6 over 10s)  defined/compositeresourcedefinition.apiextensions.crossplane.io  cannot render composed resource from resource template at index 3: cannot use dry-run create to name composed resource: an empty namespace may not be set during creation
    Normal   ComposeResources         6s (x6 over 10s)  defined/compositeresourcedefinition.apiextensions.crossplane.io  Successfully composed resources
    ```
5. We see errors in the events. It is complaining about not specifying namespace in its compositions. For this particular kind of error, we can get its sub-resources and check which one is not created.

    ```bash
    # kubectl get xexampleapp example-application-xqlsz -o=jsonpath='{.spec.resourceRef}{" "}{.spec.resourceRefs}' | jq
    [
        {
            "apiVersion": "awsblueprints.io/v1alpha1",
            "kind": "XDynamoDBTable",
            "name": "example-application-xqlsz-6j9nm"
        },
        {
            "apiVersion": "awsblueprints.io/v1alpha1",
            "kind": "XIAMPolicy",
            "name": "example-application-xqlsz-lp9wt"
        },
        {
            "apiVersion": "awsblueprints.io/v1alpha1",
            "kind": "XIAMPolicy",
            "name": "example-application-xqlsz-btwkn"
        },
        {
            "apiVersion": "awsblueprints.io/v1alpha1",
            "kind": "IRSA"
        }
    ]
    ```
6. Notice the last element in the array does not have a name. When a resource in composition fails validation, the resource object is not created and will not have a name. For this particular issue, we need to specify the namespace for the IRSA resource.

### Composition Definition

Debugging Composition Definitions is similar to debugging Compositions.

1. Get XRD
    ```bash
    # kubectl get xrd testing.awsblueprints.io
    NAME                       ESTABLISHED   OFFERED   AGE
    testing.awsblueprints.io                           66s
    ```
2. Notice its status it not established. We describe this XRD to get its events
    ```bash
    # kubectl describe xrd testing.awsblueprints.io
    Events:
    Type     Reason              Age                    From                                                             Message
    ----     ------              ----                   ----                                                             -------
    Normal   ApplyClusterRoles   3m19s (x3 over 3m19s)  rbac/compositeresourcedefinition.apiextensions.crossplane.io     Applied RBAC ClusterRoles
    Normal   RenderCRD           18s (x9 over 3m19s)    defined/compositeresourcedefinition.apiextensions.crossplane.io  Rendered composite resource CustomResourceDefinition
    Warning  EstablishComposite  18s (x9 over 3m19s)    defined/compositeresourcedefinition.apiextensions.crossplane.io  cannot apply rendered composite resource CustomResourceDefinition: cannot create object: CustomResourceDefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io "testing.awsblueprints.io" is invalid: metadata.name: Invalid value: "testing.awsblueprints.io": must be spec.names.plural+"."+spec.group
    ```
3. We see in the events that CRD cannot be generated for this XRD. In this case, we need to ensure the name is `spec.names.plural+"."+spec.group`


### Providers

There are two ways to install providers in Crossplane. Using `configuration.pkg.crossplane.io` and `provider.pkg.crossplane.io`. In this repository, we use `provider.pkg.crossplane.io`. 
Note that if you define a `configuration.pkg.crossplane.io` object, Crossplane will create a `provider.pkg.crossplane.io` object. This object is managed by Crossplane. Please refer to [this guide](https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/blob/master/docs/concepts/packages.md) for more information about Crossplane Packages.

If you are experiencing provider issues, steps below are a good starting point. 

1. Check the status of provider object. 
    ```bash
    # kubectl describe provider.pkg.crossplane.io provider-aws
    Status:
        Conditions:
            Last Transition Time:  2022-08-04T16:19:44Z
            Reason:                HealthyPackageRevision
            Status:                True
            Type:                  Healthy
            Last Transition Time:  2022-08-04T16:14:29Z
            Reason:                ActivePackageRevision
            Status:                True
            Type:                  Installed
        Current Identifier:      crossplane/provider-aws:v0.29.0
        Current Revision:        provider-aws-a2e16ca2fc1a
    Events:
        Type    Reason                  Age                      From                                 Message
        ----    ------                  ----                     ----                                 -------
        Normal  InstallPackageRevision  9m49s (x237 over 4d17h)  packages/provider.pkg.crossplane.io  Successfully installed package revision
    ```
    In the output above we see that this provider is healthy. To get more information about this provider, we can dig deeper. The `Current Revision` field let us know of our next object to look at. 


2. When you create a provider object, Crossplane will create a `ProviderRevision` object based on the contents of the OCI image. In this example, we are specifying the OCI image to be `crossplane/provider-aws:v0.29.0`. This image contains a YAML file which defines many Kubernetes objects such as Deployment, ServiceAccount, and CRDs.
The `ProviderRevision` object creates resources necessary for a provider to function based on the contents of the YAML file. To inspect what is deployed as part of the provider package, we inspect the ProviderRevision object. The `Current Revision` field above indicates which ProviderRevision object is currently used for this provider.

    ```bash
    # kubectl get providerrevision provider-aws-a2e16ca2fc1a

    NAME                        HEALTHY   REVISION   IMAGE                             STATE    DEP-FOUND   DEP-INSTALLED   AGE
    provider-aws-a2e16ca2fc1a   True      1          crossplane/provider-aws:v0.29.0   Active                               19d
    ```

    When you describe the object, you will find that many objects are managed by this same object. 
    

    ```bash
    # kubectl describe providerrevision provider-aws-a2e16ca2fc1a

    Status:
        Controller Ref:
            Name:  provider-aws-a2e16ca2fc1a
        Object Refs:
            API Version:  apiextensions.k8s.io/v1
            Kind:         CustomResourceDefinition
            Name:         natgateways.ec2.aws.crossplane.io
            UID:          5c36d1bc-61b8-44f8-bca0-47e368af87a9
            ....
    Events:
        Type    Reason             Age                    From                                         Message
        ----    ------             ----                   ----                                         -------
        Normal  SyncPackage        22m (x369 over 4d18h)  packages/providerrevision.pkg.crossplane.io  Successfully configured package revision
        Normal  BindClusterRole    15m (x348 over 4d18h)  rbac/providerrevision.pkg.crossplane.io      Bound system ClusterRole to provider ServiceAccount(s)
        Normal  ApplyClusterRoles  15m (x364 over 4d18h)  rbac/providerrevision.pkg.crossplane.io      Applied RBAC ClusterRoles
    ```
    
    The event field will also indicate any issues that may have occurred during this process. 
3. If you do not see any errors in the event field above, you should check if deployments and pods were provisioned successfully. As a part of the provider configuration process, a deployment is created:

    ```bash
    # kubectl get deployment -n crossplane-system

    NAME                        READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
    crossplane                  1/1     1            1           105d
    crossplane-rbac-manager     1/1     1            1           105d
    provider-aws-a2e16ca2fc1a   1/1     1            1           19d

    # kubectl get pods -n crossplane-system
    NAME                                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    crossplane-54db688c8d-qng6b                  2/2     Running   0          4d19h
    crossplane-rbac-manager-5776c9fbf4-wn5rj     1/1     Running   0          4d19h
    provider-aws-a2e16ca2fc1a-776769ccbd-4dqml   1/1     Running   0          4d23h
    ```
    If there are any pods failing, check its logs and remedy the problem.
